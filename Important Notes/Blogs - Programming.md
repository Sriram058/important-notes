- [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/), the guy who wrote Road to React along with a few other great courses, has an incredibly thorough [blog](https://www.robinwieruch.de/blog/) that teaches a lot of JS/React/Webpack/etc topics. They're very easy to follow and well-written. His Road to React course is also superb.
