# Recommendations for quality React.js /WebDev YouTube content creators that help you stay up to date / learn?

Since I couldn't find anything like this on the sidebar / faq of the r/reactjs subreddit, I thought it a good idea to get a list of video-focused resources going.

Here are some I like off the top of my mind, but I'd be happy to hear more and will try to update this list as more responses are added for easier bookmarking. Bonus points if you can include the channel's main focus, or some disclaimer about its content we should be wary about.

- Fireship, General WebDev Channel that explains a lot of great concepts in byte sized videos, [https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship)
- Jack Herrington, React.js, massively underrated well explained videos so I'm expecting his channel to keep growing fast, [https://www.youtube.com/c/JackHerrington](https://www.youtube.com/c/JackHerrington)
- Theo, React.js, ex-Twitch engineer that can be arrogant / biased with very strong opinions which I would NOT recommend for beginners as he can be highly misleading and lead people down the wrong path. But if you are an experienced dev that isn't easily convinced by things at face-value & able to form your own opinion with critical thinking skills, its a fantastic resource to hear about modern web trends. I enjoy his channel, but it's 100% not without massive flaws. [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoBrowne1017](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoBrowne1017)
- Tyler McGinnis, General WebDev + React.js and one of the best tutors in the community (alongside Kent C Dodds), great quality but posts very rarely, [https://www.youtube.com/c/uidotdev](https://www.youtube.com/c/uidotdev)
- Design Course, Front End Focused Channel, [https://www.youtube.com/c/DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/c/DesignCourse)
- Dave Gray, General Web Dev, [https://www.youtube.com/c/DaveGrayTeachesCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaveGrayTeachesCode)
- Web Dev Simplified, React.js, Decent resource for beginners (not so much for experienced devs) with occasionally great content, but it's buried under a large amount of clickbait videos and pitches to sell his paid courses, [https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified)
- Alex Trost, General Web Dev, recordings of Twitch.tv streaming show about front end trends, [https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTrosts](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTrosts)
- Codeevolution, General Web Dev, [https://www.youtube.com/c/DaveGrayTeachesCode/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaveGrayTeachesCode/videos)
- Traversy Media, General WebDev, has some occasionally incredible content, though quality varies a lot. Some videos are ridiculously good, while others have dull presentations (similar to corporate training courses) and presenters with zero-enthusiasm, [https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia)

**edit**: Added more resources from the comments

**edit2**: There's been a few channel recommendations from what seem like tech-influencers providing mostly career-advice of varying quality. Thoughts on adding them to the edited list once I have time? I might be biased here, but I'm personally not 100% sold of them, since a lot of them seem like they provide very little value beyond just making money of easily impressional folk with superficial or unrealistic advice based on their "success stories".

**edit3**: Added more resources from the comments. Ignored any channels that aren't strictly react / front-end related since this is r/reactjs, as well as channels that fit the tech-influencer stereotype from edit2.
