# Degree/diploma suggestion regarding MERN stack developer

Certifications/Diplomas in general have very little worth in this area unless they are strictly Computer Science related. Likely because programing languages and libraries evolve so fast, certifications and diplomas become pointless as time goes on rapidly. Unless you have formal CS education, most companies value experience and personal projects far above any diploma or certification.

If you wish to get into this field, I see 3 routes:

- If you prefer structure and formal education, pursue a computer science bachelors or masters degree. This will be the most expensive and long method to get into the market, but it works.
- If you have the money, there are some great, but pricy, bootcamps that can guide you to build personal projects that can land you a job.
- If you already have the knowledge, just start building personal portfolio projects and a personal website to showcase them. That should be more than enough to land you a job.

Thanks for the response, Iâ€™ve already done the 3rd point but it didnâ€™t help me much to land a job.

This is the reason Iâ€™m trying to pursue masters if itâ€™s related to this field. Iâ€™ve heard information systems masters focuses on this but Iâ€™m not ðŸ’¯ so the question. I wouldnâ€™t mind paying some money if I could get into something that I like. So any help/suggestions regarding the diploma/masters would be helpful.

Iâ€™ve done some research but some of the college that teach information systems are either very old technologies or they do not have MERN in their curriculum.

Hire a mentor then. It'll be a lot more cost effective than pursuing a masters.

If you already did point #3, you shouldn't just give up. You need to figure out why you aren't finding success with your current portfolio.

Are you being called for interviews?

- If yes, are you asking for honest feedback at the end of it? This is invaluable advice to get better, and few people realize you can actually ask for it. Obviously you should not ask wether you failed or passed the interview, but it's not invalid to ask for "areas of improvement" they think you could get better at.
- If no, then that's what a mentor is for. To understand what it is about your profile that makes it hard for you to get hired.

Find someone that has years of experience (+5-10 if possible), and has been in the hiring seat before. Pay them to get honest feedback about your resume, portfolio, skillset, soft skills, etc. You can find one on places like [r/forhire](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/) by making an offer, or even [codementor.io](https://codementor.io/) . I used to do private 1:1 mentorship and got some people hired in the past, so I know it works. I'm no longer in that market due to a lack of time since it was more of a side gig. Hope it helps!
