# Any Advice For A Newbie React Dev?

- Avoid Duplications by making your code more reusable

Just as long as he follows [A.H.A.](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming) (Avoiding Hasty Abstractions)

- If you code in JavaScript, Try to learn TypeScript for React (Watch React+TS Course)

Anytime you're learning any new technology, focus on learning things one step at a time, not multiple at the same time. So learn TypeScript without React first. And I would say only move into the next pillar until you mastered the previous one. Otherwise when you're stuck, you'll be scratching your head on what part of the tech stack the issue is even about.

Also, I'd add to this you should prioritize JSDoc before TypeScript. It's much easier to implement and requires no build pipeline whatsoever, and sets you up to learn TypeScript much faster.

- Pay attention to Memoization on React, HOC, Axios Interceptors.

I think a better learning path here is learning about the problems these solve, and not the solution themselves first.

Honestly, this comment reminds me of what I hate about people giving programing advice. Everyone rushes to recommend "Learn X because everyone does it!", without fully elaborating on why it's important to learn X.
