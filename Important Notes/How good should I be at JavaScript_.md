# How good should I be at JavaScript?

Stop building projects and focus maxing out JavaScript before messing around with React. You can do this even with a small amount of time by reading something like the You Don't Know JS series. It's a short book series free to read online from famous JS advocate Kyle Simpson:

It'll teach you more about JavaScript in a few days that most people learn by building projects over first 3-5 years. I read that around year 2 of my career, and I deeply regretted not reading it earlier. It also set me up to ace almost every JS interview I've taken ever since.

You might be thinking: "But shouldn't I focus on React to get hired?". The answer is no. No smart employer will hire a React Developer with a bad JavaScript foundation. Hell, we've hired developers who may not have the best React skills but had incredible JavaScript foundations, since we knew they would likely learn React in a heartbeat. Thus the importance of a strong foundation so your React skills actually stick.
